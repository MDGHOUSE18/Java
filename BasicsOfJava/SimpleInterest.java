/*Simple interest is a quick method of calculating the interest charge on a loan. Simple interest is determined by multiplying the daily interest rate by the principal by the number of days that elapse between payments. 

Simple interest formula is given by:
Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 
Where, 
P is the principal amount 
T is the time and 
R is the rate
Examples: â€“
Example 1:
Input :  P = 10000
         R = 5
         T = 5
Output : 2500
Explanation - We need to find simple interest on 
Rs. 10, 000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
units of time.
Example 2:
Input :  P = 3000
         R = 7
         T = 1
Output : 210 */
